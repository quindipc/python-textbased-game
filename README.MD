# Text-Based Adventure Game

## My process

### Built with

- Python

### What I learned
This is my first text-based adventure game created on Python. I am understanding a little bit more about functions, if statements and else statements


### Continued development
I want to learn more about the time sleep module on python and more about input(). I want to figure out a cleaner way to write this and learn more about key presses as well. I think moving forward, If I want to create a game or a story with options, I should draw it out visually on a flowchart first.
